Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction
This project investigates passenger survival on the Titanic disaster using supervised machine learning classification algorithms.

Libraries Used:

pandas (data manipulation)
scikit-learn (machine learning)
Data Description:

The dataset used is a public record of passengers aboard the Titanic (source can be specified here, e.g., https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). It includes features like passenger class, age, sex, fare, etc.

Methodology:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset was loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values and prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
Splitting Data: The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing sets for model evaluation.
Classification Models: The following classification algorithms from scikit-learn were implemented:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Model Evaluation: Each model was trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data. The accuracy score was recorded for each model.
